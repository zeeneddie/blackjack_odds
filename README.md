## Synopsis

There are much better tools for this. I wrote this from scratch without any references just to practice. If you are looking for a reference, this may not be the one to look into but it does work.

Checks the probability of drawing a card where you don't lose in a game of blackjack. For each card that could be drawn where you don't lose it adds one to a total, taking into account an ace being one or eleven, and then divides by the total number of cards. At the end it translates the number into a percent.
